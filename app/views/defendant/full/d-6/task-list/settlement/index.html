      <p>A settlement agreement is a legal agreement between you and the claimant describing how and when you will repay them.</p>
      <p>If the claimant chooses to sign your agreement, the claim will be put on hold and they will not be able to issue a CCJ against you unless you break the agreement.</p>
      <p>If they do not sign the settlement agreement, they are still able to issue a CCJ against you.</p>
