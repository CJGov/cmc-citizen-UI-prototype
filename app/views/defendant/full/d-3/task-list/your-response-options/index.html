          <h3 class="heading-medium">Admit all of the claim </h3>

          <p>If you admit all of the claim is fair you can contact the claimant yourself and pay the money. Ask them to let the court know when they have your payment.</p>

          <p>If you can't afford to pay it all at once you can suggest a repayment plan for them to consider.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Admit part of the claim</h3>

          <p>If you think the claim is too high you can offer the amount you think you owe as part of your defence. You’ll get the chance to explain why your offer is the amount you believe you owe.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Reject the claim</h3>

          <p>If you don't accept you owe the amount of money claimed you can prepare and submit your defence online. You might have to go to a hearing - it can take up to 7 months to get a hearing date.</p>

            Settle out of court 
          </h2>
          <p>You might be able to resolve the dispute without going to court. You can do this as part of completing your defence to the claim.</p>

          <p>If you reject the claim or admit you owe less than the full amount claimed, you can make an offer or ask for mediation to settle the claim.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">
            Make an offer
          </h2>
          <p>You can try to settle the claim by making the claimant an offer. For example, you could offer to repair damage you have caused to the claimant’s property or replace faulty goods you supplied them.</p>

          <p>If the claimant rejects your offer you’ll have to go a hearing. The claimant can’t mention that you made them an offer at the hearing.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">
            Mediate 
          </h2>
          <p>You can ask for mediation to settle the claim. If the claimant agrees to use the mediation service, you could settle the claim without going to court.</p> -->

         <h3 class="heading-large">County Court Judgment (CCJ) -  when you might get a CCJ</h3> 

          <p>The claimant can ask for a CCJ to be made against you if you admit the claim. This is a ‘judgment by admission’ and means the court orders you to pay the claim.</p>

          <p>Details of the CCJ will be entered on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines. Your name could stay on this Register for 6 years unless you pay the total amount you owe.</p>

         <h3 class="heading-medium"> If you pay within 28 days</h3>

          <p>You can apply for a certificate of cancellation to get your name removed from the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines using <a href="https://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1157" target="blank">form N443</a> (opens in new window). This application costs £15.</p>

           <h3 class="heading-medium"> If you pay after 1 month</h3>
                <p>You can apply for a certificate of satisfaction to get your debt marked as ‘satisfied’ in the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines using <a href="https://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1157" target="blank">form N443</a> (opens in new window). This application costs £15.</p>

                <p>Your name will stay on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines for 6 years but people searching it will see that you’ve paid.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">Reject the claim</h3>
                <p>If you reject the claim and lose your case, then you’ll get a CCJ ordering you to pay the full claim amount and any costs. Details of the CCJ will be entered on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines for 6 years.</p>
