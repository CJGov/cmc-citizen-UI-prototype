          <h3 class="heading-medium">Admit all of the claim </h3>

          <p>If you admit all of the claim is fair you can contact the claimant yourself and pay the money. Ask them to let the court know when they have your payment.</p>

          <p>If you can't afford to pay it all at once you can suggest a repayment plan for them to consider.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Admit part of the claim</h3>

          <p>If you think the claim is too high you can offer the amount you think you owe as part of your defence. You’ll get the chance to explain why your offer is the amount you believe you owe.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">If you think you’re owed money</h3>
      <p>If you believe the claimant owes you money you can make a claim against them (‘counterclaim’). You can do this as part of your defence.</p>
