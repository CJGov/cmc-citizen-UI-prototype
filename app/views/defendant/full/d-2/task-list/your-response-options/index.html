        <h3 class="heading-medium">Admit all of the claim </h3>

        <p>If you admit all of the claim is fair you can contact the claimant yourself and pay the money. Ask them to let the court know when they have your payment.</p>

        <p>If you can't afford to pay it all at once you can suggest a repayment plan for them to consider.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">Reject the claim</h3>

      </p>If you don't accept you owe the amount of money claimed you can prepare and submit your defence online. You might have to go to a hearing - it can take up to 7 months to get a hearing date.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Make a deal</h3>

      <p>You can try to settle the claim by making the claimant an offer. If the claimant rejects your offer you’ll have to go a hearing. The claimant can’t mention that you made them an offer at the hearing.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">If you think you’re owed money</h3>
      <p>If you believe the claimant owes you money you can make a claim against them (‘counterclaim’). Download and fill in <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659">Defence and Counterclaim form N9B</a>.
