        <h3 class="heading-medium">Terms of the agreement</h3>
        <p>This agreement settles the claim made by Jan Clark against Mary Richards. This includes all money owed in the case. For example counterclaims, court fees, expenses or interest.</p>
        <p>If the agreement is kept neither Jan Clark or Mary Richards can make any further claims relating to this case.</p>
        <p>This agreement is confidential until you have both signed it. After that it can be used in court, for example if the agreement is broken.

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If the agreement is broken</h3>
        <p>Jan Clark or Mary Richards can ask the court to:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>request a judgment for any money still owed from this agreement</li>
          <li>restart the original claim or counterclaim</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="">Fill in form N244</a> to apply for either and send it to the relevant county court.</p>
        <p>The orginal claim will be kept on hold until this agreement is completed. We'll close the claim on [date].</p>
