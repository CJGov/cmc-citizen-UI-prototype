        Make an offer to settle out of court
      </h1>
      <p>You can avoid getting a County Court Judgment (CCJ) if you settle out of court. There will be no public record of the claim.</p>
      <p>If Jan Clark accepts your offer you'll both have to sign a legal agreement. This agreement will replace the claim.</p>
      <p>If Jan Clark rejects your offer it can't be mentioned in court.</p>
