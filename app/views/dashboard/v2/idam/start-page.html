            Respond to a  money claim
          </h1>
          <p>You need to respond to the money claim within 14 days of receiving the claim.</p>
          <p>Your response will be sent to the claimant (the person or organisation who says you owe them money). If the claimant accepts your offer then the claim is closed. If the claimant rejects your offer then they will consider your response to their claim.</p>
          <p>The claimant can apply for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt">County Court Judgment (CCJ)</a> against you if you don't respond within 14 days of receiving the claim. They can then use this to get the money from you. For example, they could hire bailiffs.</p>
          <p>You might be able to settle the claim out of court by making an offer. For example, you could offer to fix faulty goods you sold the claimant or offer them money to close the claim.</p>
          <p>If you make an offer you also need to respond to the money claim.</p>

            Make an offer to settle out of court
          </h1>

          <p>You could settle this money claim without going to court if you make an offer and reach an agreement.</p>

          <p>If your offer is accepted and you settle the claim, then it’s confidential. This means there won’t be a public record of the claim made against you and you won’t get a County Court Judgment.</p>

          <p>If the claimant accepts your offer then it’s legally enforceable. This means you must do what you’ve agreed or the claimant can ask the court to make a County Court Judgment against you.</p>

          <p>If the claimant rejects your offer they can’t bring it up if you go to a court hearing.</p>

         <h2 class="heading-medium">Your response options</h2>
         <h3 class="heading-small">Accept the money claim</h3>
         <p>If you accept the claim is fair you can contact the claimant yourself and pay the money. Ask them to let the court know when they have your payment.</p>
         <p>If you can't afford to pay it all at once you can suggest a <a href="https://hmcts-cmc-prototype.herokuapp.com/prototype-18/owe-all/payment-options?radio-input-group=Cannot-afford">repayment plan</a> for them to consider.</p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">Reject the claim</h3>
       </p>If you don't accept you owe the amount of money claimed you can prepare and submit your defence online. You might have to go to a hearing - it can take up to 7 months to get a hearing date.</p>
       <h3 class="heading-small">Make a deal</h3>
       <p>You can try to settle the claim by making the claimant an offer. If the claimant rejects your offer you’ll have to go a hearing. The claimant can’t mention that you made them an offer at the hearing.</p>
       <h3 class="heading-small">If you think you’re owed money</h3>
       <p>If you believe the claimant owes you money you can make a claim against them (‘counterclaim’). Download and fill in <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659">Defence and Counterclaim form N9B</a>.
        <p>You might have to pay a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/court-fees">court fee</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">If you can't afford to pay the money back</h3>
        <p>You might be able to get free legal advice to help you deal with debt from organisations like <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/">StepChange</a>.</p>
