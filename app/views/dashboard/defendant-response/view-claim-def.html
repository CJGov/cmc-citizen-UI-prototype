      <h2 class="heading-small">Their response to your claim</h2>
      <p>The defendant Mary Richards has rejected your claim. They have asked for mediation to help resolve this dispute<!--  They have also offered a suggestion to resolve this claim. --></p>


            <p class="heading-small">Why they rejected your claim</p>

      <p>The work on the roof was completed as per the contract.</p>
      <p>Jan says she contacted me but I didn't get a call or an email - I'd have been happy to take a look at the roof and see if there was a problem. There shouldn't be a need to get someone else in and the quote of Â£1,500 sounds high.
