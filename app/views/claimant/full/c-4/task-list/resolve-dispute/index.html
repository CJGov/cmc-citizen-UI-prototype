          Try to resolve the dispute

          </h1>

          <p>It could count against you in court if you make a claim without contacting the person or organisation to resolve the claim.</p>

          <p>Before you claim you should:

            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>talk to the person who owes you</li>
                <li>consider mediation</li>

          <h2 class="heading-medium">Talk to the person who owes you</h2>

          <p>Try to resolve the dispute by:</p>

          <ul class="list list-bullet">

              <li>telling them what you believe they owe and why</li>
              <li>suggesting a timetable for them to pay you back
              </li>
              <li> explaining you'll make a money claim against them if they don't pay
              <li>telling them that they might have to pay the full amount as well as <a
                      href="https://www.gov.uk/court-fees-what-they-are">fees
                  and other costs</a> if they
                  ‘defend the claim’, and that they could get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/overview">County Court Judgment (CCJ)</a>.
              </li>
          </uL>



          <h2 class="heading-medium">Consider mediation</h2>
        <p>Mediation is when an impartial person helps both sides to agree - it can be quicker and cheaper than making a claim.</p>


              <p>It can often be done on the phone. If you don't want to
              speak to the person you're claiming against, a mediator can speak to you both separately.</p>
