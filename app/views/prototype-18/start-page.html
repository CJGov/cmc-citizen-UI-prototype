        Respond to a  money claim
      </h1>

      <p>You must respond to the money claim by [date].</p>

      <p>[claimant name] can apply for a County Court Judgment (CCJ) against you if you don't respond in time. They can then use this to get the money from you. For example, they could hire bailiffs.</p>
<p>A CCJ also makes it harder for you to get things like a bank loan, credit card or mortgage.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Accept the money claim</h2>

      <p>If you accept the claim is fair you can contact [name of claimant] yourself and pay the money. Ask them to let the court know when they have your payment.</p>

      <p>If you can't afford to pay it all at once you can suggest a <a href="https://hmcts-cmc-prototype.herokuapp.com/prototype-18/owe-all/payment-options?radio-input-group=Cannot-afford">repayment plan</a> for them to consider.</p?

<h2 class="heading-medium">Reject the claim</h2>

      </p>If you don't accept you owe the amount of money claimed you can prepare and submit your defence online. You might have to go to a hearing - it can take up to 7 months to get a hearing date.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Make a deal</h2>

      <p>You can try to settle the claim by making [name of claimant] an offer. If [name of claimant] rejects your offer you’ll have to go a hearing. [name of claimant] can’t mention that you made them an offer at the hearing.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">If you think you’re owed money</h2>
<p>If you believe the claimant owes you money you can make a claim against them (‘counterclaim’). Download and fill in <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659">Defence and Counterclaim form N9B</a>.
<p>You might have to pay a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/court-fees">court fee</a>.</p>
  
      <h2 class="heading-medium">If you can't afford to pay the money back</h2>
      <p>You might be able to get free legal advice to help you deal with debt from organisations like <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/">StepChange</a>.</p>
