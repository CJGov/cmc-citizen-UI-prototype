<h3 class="heading-medium">Settle out of court</h3>
<p>You can still <a href='../dashboard/offer-agreement/make-offer?defendant=defendant'>settle the claim out of court</a>. For example, you could offer to fix faulty goods you sold the claimant or suggest a payment.</p>
<p>You can avoid getting a County Court Judgment if the claimant accepts your offer. The court claim is then closed.</p>
