      The defendant's response

              <p> Mary Richards says says they paid you  £{{ data['owe-amount'] or '1,200' }}  - they said they don't owe the full amount you claimed.<p>

         <p class="heading-small">When they paid this amount</p>
      <p>{{ now | date('add' , 3 , 'days') | date( 'subtract', 1, 'months') | date }}</p>

      <p class="heading-small">How they say they paid</p>
      <p>I paid by cheque and posted it to Jan Clark.</p>

      <p class="heading-small">Why they don't owe the full amount claimed</p>



<p>The amount I was quoted for was £1,000. Im not sure where the additional £500 is coming from. Im not paying the court fee as this should have been settled for the claim was issued.</p>
