      <p>You can offer a settlement agreement - a legal agreement you sign which describes how you'll pay the money back.</p>

      <p>We'll send it to the claimant and they can choose to sign it or issue a County Court Judgment (CCJ) against you.</p>

      <p>Even if they accept your repayment plan they can still refuse to sign a settlement agreement. They can issue a CCJ against you instead.</p>

      <p>If they sign, the claim is put on hold and they can't issue a CCJ against you unless you break the terms of the agreement.</p>
