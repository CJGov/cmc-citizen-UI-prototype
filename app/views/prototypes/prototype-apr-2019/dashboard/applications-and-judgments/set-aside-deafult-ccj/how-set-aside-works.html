        Remove your CCJ and respond to the claim
      </h1>

      <p>Requesting a judge to remove the CCJ has a £255 fee.  This process is called 'setting aside' the CCJ</p>
      <p>As part of the process you'll need to submit evidence and probably go to a hearing. You'll still have the CCJ until the hearing.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">If your request is successful</h3>
      <p>The will CCJ removed and you'll have to respond to the claim against you.</p>
      <p>You probably won't get the £255 fee back.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">If your request isn't successful</h3>
      <p>You will have to pay Mrs Jan Clark the full £1500 in the claim.</p>
      <p>You won't get the £255 fee back and your CCJ will remain for 6 years.</p>
