        <h1 class="heading-large">Using an expert in small claims</h1>
          
        <h2 class="heading-medium">When an expert is required</h2>
        <p>An expert is only required in exceptional circumstances where specialist knowledge is required to make a decision.</p>
        <p>For example, a structural engineer might be required in a disputes over building works or a mechanic in a claim about car repairs.</p>
        <p>You must request the court's permission to use an expert. Permission will only be given when a judge believes it is both necessary and the costs are reasonable.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">When qualifies as an expert?</h2>
        <p>An expert must be independant, with no prior knowledge of the case.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Costs</h2>
        <p>Both you and the defendant will need to split the cost of the expert but if the judge rules in your favour they can order the defendant to repay you up to Â£750 of your half.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">What you'll need to do</h2>
        <p>You'll need to:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>make a shortlist of three independant experts who are willing to provide a written report in return for a fee</li>
          <li>you must not discuss the case with the experts before they are appointed</li>
          <li>let us know the names and costs of your chosen experts</li>
          <li>the defendant will pick one expert to use from your shortlist</li>
          <li>you and the defendant will pay the expert</li>
          <li>you and the defendant will both provide questions to ask the expert</li>
          <li>you will send the compelete set of questions to the expert</li>
          <li>the expert will have XX days to provide a written report</li>
          <li>you will need to upload the expert's report</li>
          <li>you and the defendant will both list any queries you have about the expert's report</li>
          <li>you will send the compelete set of queries to the expert</li>
          <li>the expert will have XX days to provide a written response</li>
          <li>you will need to upload the expert's response</li>
        </ul>
