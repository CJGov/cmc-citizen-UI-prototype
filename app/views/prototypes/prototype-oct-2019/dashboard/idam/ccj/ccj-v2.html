        You have a County Court Judgment (CCJ)
      </h1>

      <p>Sam Clark requested a CCJ against you because you didn't respond to their money claim.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium" style="margin-top:40px;">What this means</h3>
      <p>The court believes you owe Sam Clark Â£1,500.</p>
      <p>A CCJ may make it harder to get credit, such as a mobile phone contract, credit card or mortgage.</p>
      <p>You can't respond to the claim while you have a CCJ against you.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium" style="margin-top:40px;">If you don't pay</h3>
            <p>Sam Clark can use enforcement options to recover the money. These include asking the court to:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
              <li>send bailiffs to collect the money</li>
              <li>take money out of your wages or any sale of land or property</li>
                </ul>

      <p>You can see the details of the original claim on the next page.</p>
