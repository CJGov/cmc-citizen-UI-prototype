           How to cancel a judgment
         </h1>

         <div class="panel panel-border-narrow"  style="padding-bottom:15px;">
             <p>The court will usually only cancel a judgment if it accepts you didn't know about the claim at the time it was issued.</p>
         </div>



        <p>To apply to cancel a judgment you must follow these steps:</p>
        <ol class="list list-number">
          <li>Explain why you think the judgment should be cancelled</li>
          <li>Pay a fee of £255</li>
          <li>Submit a defence to the original claim</li>
          <li>Go to a hearing about the judgment, in most cases</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If the court cancels the judgment</h3>
        <p>We'll send your claim defence to Sam Clark and ask them to respond.</p>
        <p>You might have to go to another hearing, about the claim itself.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If your request is rejected</h3>
        <p>Your defence will be cancelled. You'll have to pay according to the terms of the judgment.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If you decide not to apply</h3>
        <p>You can pay a £50 fee to ask to change the judgment's payment terms.</p>
        <p>You'll still owe the full claim amount, but you can ask to pay at a later date or in instalments.</p>
