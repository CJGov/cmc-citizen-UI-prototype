          Making a claim doesn't guarantee getting money back
        </h1>

        <p>Even if you win your case or the defendant admits they owe money, you may not get the money back.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">Consider their financial situation before you claim</h3>

        <p>Think about how likely it is that they'll ever have the money to pay you.</p>

        <p>It'll be harder to get money back if they:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>have no money or source of income</li>
          <li>don't own anything they can sell to get the money</li>
          <li>have a County Court Judgment (CCJ) or several of them (this suggests a history of unpaid debts)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can <a href="https://www.trustonline.org.uk/" target="_blank">search the Registry Trust to find out if a person or company has CCJs</a> (opens in a new window). This costs £6 to £10.</p>
        <p>If they have several CCJs against them, it might be less likely that you get paid.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">How the court can help if you win</h3>

        <p>If you win, you don't get paid automatically but you can ask the court to:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>give the defendant a CCJ which orders them to pay</li>
          <li>order them to share details about their income and spending so you see what they can afford</li>
          <li>send bailiffs to their home or business to see if anything can be sold to pay the debt</li>
          <li>have money deducted from their wages</li>
          <li>freeze assets or money in their account</li>
          <li>order for any money from property or land sales to be used to pay the debt</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Requesting a CCJ is free but the other requests cost an extra fee. They don't guarantee you get paid.</p>
