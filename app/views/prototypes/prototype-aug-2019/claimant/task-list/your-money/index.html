          Getting your money back
        </h1>

        <p>Even if you win your case, you may not get your money back.</p>
        <p>The court can order the other party to pay you, using a County Court Judgment (CCJ) and there are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/enforce-a-judgment" target="_blank">methods of enforcing the CCJ</a> (opens in a new window), such as the use of bailiffs, but these are not always successful.</p>

        <p>Before making a claim you should consider:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>do they have the money available to pay you?</li>
          <li>do they have anything that could be sold to pay the debt?</li>
          <li>do they have any existing CCJs?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can search to <a href="https://www.trustonline.org.uk/" target="_blank">find out if a company has any existing CCJs</a> (opens in a new window) for a small fee.</p>
        <p>If they have already have several judgments against them, you should consider whether they are able to pay you as well.</p>
