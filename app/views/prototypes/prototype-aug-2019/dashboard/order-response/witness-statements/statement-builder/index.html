        <p>We'll now ask you some questions and use your answers to make a 'witness statement'. This a document that sets out your view of the case.</p>

        <p>A judge will read the witness statement - in your answers you should:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>state facts, not opinions</li>
          <li>be as clear as possible, especially about facts and evidence</li>
          <li>include dates and a timeline if you can</li>
          <li>stick to the details of this case</li>
          <li>explain any differences between your view of the case and the defendant's</li>
          <li>try to answer any questions a judge might have about the case</li>
          <li>explain any jargon or technical language (use simple language if you can)</li>
          <li>tell the truth</li>
        </ul>
