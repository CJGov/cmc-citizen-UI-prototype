          <h2 class="heading-small">Claim description</h2>
          <p>This claim is about building works.</p>
          <p>Mary Richards and I signed a contract for building works on my roof. The work on the roof was completed but there was a problem with one section. I asked Mary Richards to get the problem fixed, but didn't get a reply.</p>
          <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,430.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I'm making a money claim for £1,500 to compensate for the extra money I am going to need to spend.</p>
