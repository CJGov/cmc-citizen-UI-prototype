        Accessibility statement for the Online Civil Money Claims service

        This service allows you to make a money claim against an individual or an organisation for £10,000 or less.

        This website is run by HM Courts and Tribunals Services (HMCTS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use it, so we’ve designed it to be accessible.
        That means you should be able to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

        How accessible is this website?

        We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Some elements either did not contain discernible text or are not descriptive enough for users to determine their function or purpose.</li>
        <li>Screen reader users may find the general navigation of pages difficult due to multiple generic page titles and illogical heading structures. </li>
        <li>Vision and mobility impaired users may encounter elements that are not accessible to standard keyboard commands or voice activation software. </li>

          The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

        <p>
          Some PDFs, documents, and attachments to email notifications may not meet accessibility standards or work with a screen reader.
          This is because they were created before current accessibility legislation was introduced. We plan to make them accessible by September 2020. (TBD)

          Non-Descriptive Form Elements

        <p>Form elements are present that are not descriptive of their function or purpose. This also includes some radio buttons and checkboxes. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).</p>



        <h4 class="bold">  Status Message <h4>
          <p>Screen reader users are not informed of important information when it becomes available.  The issue occurs with JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver for iPhone. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.3 (Status Messages).</p>

          <h4 class="bold">Colours of non-text elements <h4>
            <p>There were some elements present that had a colour used for styling focus indication that did not pass the expected ratio. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast).</p>

                Disproportionate burden (TBD)

              <p>
                We believe fixing some issues would be a disproportionate burden - this means we’ve decided the time it would take would not be worth it for the limited benefit to accessibility.

              <p>
                Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.
              </p>

              <p>
                The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2020 if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential document].
                Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
