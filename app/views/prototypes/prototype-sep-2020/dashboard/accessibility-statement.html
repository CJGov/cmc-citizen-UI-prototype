        Accessibility statement for the Online Civil Money Claims service
      </h1>

      <p>
        This service allows you to make a money claim against an individual or an organisation for £10,000 or less.

      </p>
      <p>
        This website is run by HM Courts and Tribunals Services (HMCTS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use it, so we’ve designed it to be accessible.
        For example, you should be able to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
      </p>
