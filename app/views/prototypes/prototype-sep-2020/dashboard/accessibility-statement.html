        Accessibility statement for the Online Civil Money Claims service

      <p>
        This service allows you to make a money claim against an individual or an organisation for £10,000 or less.

        This website is run by HM Courts and Tribunals Services (HMCTS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use it, so we’ve designed it to be accessible.
        For example, you should be able to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

        How accessible is this website?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>some pages are difficult to navigate using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>some pages can’t be listened to in full using a screen reader</li>
        <li>some pages have problems with colour contrasts between text and background</li>
        <li>some PDFs may not be fully accessible to a screen reader</li>

        <li>Some elements either did not contain discernible text or are not descriptive enough for users to determine their function or purpose</li>
        <li>Screen reader users may find the general navigation of pages difficult due to multiple generic page titles and illogical heading structures </li>
        <li>Vision and mobility impaired users may encounter elements that are not accessible to standard keyboard commands or voice activation software</li>

          This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard (opens in a new window)</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.

          Non-accessible content (  //Dev team to provide more detail here.//)
        </h2>
        <p>
          HM Courts & Tribunals (HMCTS) has carried out accessibility testing using Pa11y. Pa11y is complying with WCAG 2 and Section 508 accessibility (which covers WCAG 2.1). A full accessibility audit was also completed by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) in January 2020.

        </p>
        <p>
          The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some images contain text that cannot be listened to in full using a screen reader, so some people won’t be able to access the information. </p>
        <!--
        <p>
          Some PDFs, documents, and attachments to email notifications may not meet accessibility standards or work with a screen reader.
          This is because they were created before current accessibility legislation was introduced. We plan to make them accessible by September 2020. (Date TBC)

          <p>Screen reader users are not informed of important information when it becomes available.  The issue occurs with JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver for iPhone. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.3 (Status Messages).</p>

            <p>There were some elements present that had a colour used for styling focus indication that did not pass the expected ratio. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast).</p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                Some pages cannot be navigated completely using just a keyboard, so some people won’t be able to tab through the pages. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1 (keyboard accessible).
              </p>
              <p>
Some pages can’t be listened to in full using a screen reader, so some people won’t be able to access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.5 (audio description – prerecorded).
</p>
<p>
Some of the contrast ratios don’t mind the current accessibility requirements. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (contrast – minimum).
</p>

<p>
We found the following issues that are currently being triaged:
<ul class="list list-number">
  <li> Screen readers can’t switch between headers, read content in tabs and buttons</li>
  <li> Screen readers can’t tab between radio buttons, read links or content</li>
  <li> Colour contrast ratios uneven between page background and content</li>
  <li> Some labels, fields, error messages and other content can’t be clearly identified by screen readers and voice activation software</li>
  <li> Some page headings and titles don’t follow a logical structure for screen readers</li>
  <li> The navigation of some pages isn’t clear</li>
  <li> Some headings and button labels aren’t clearly descriptive</li>

              <p>
                PDFs, documents and attachments to email notifications published before 23 September 2018 may not meet accessibility standards. For example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader.
