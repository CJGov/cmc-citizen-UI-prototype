<h2 class="heading-medium">How to remove a judgment from the register</h2>
<h4 class="heading-small">Pay in full within one month</h4>
<p>If you pay in full within one month or you've already paid, you can ask the court to remove the judgment from the register.</p>
<p>The judgment will be cancelled and won't appear in credit agency searches, though some agencies may not update their records immediately.</p>
<h4 class="heading-small">Pay in full after one month</h4>
<p>If you pay in full after one month, you can ask the court to mark the judgment as satisfied.</p>
<p>Any credit agency that checks the register will see you've paid the money, though some may not update their records immediately.</p>
  <p>The judgment will remain on the register for 6 years but it'll be marked as satisfied.</p>

 <h2 class="heading-medium">Get proof that a judgment is cancelled or satisfied</h2>
 <p>You can pay £15 to get a certificate that proves a judgment is cancelled or satisfied: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n443-application-for-a-certificate-of-satisfaction-or-cancellation">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n443-application-for-a-certificate-of-satisfaction-or-cancellation</a>.</p>

<p>If you paid in full within one month or had already paid, you can apply for a certificate of cancellation.</p>

<p>If you paid in full after a month, you can apply for a certificate of satisfaction. </p>

{% if data['check'] == 1 or data['check'] == 2 or data['check'] == 5 or data['check'] == 6 %}
<h2 class="heading-medium">If you believe you don't owe the money</h2>
<p>You can apply to the court to have them set aside the judgment. If the court agrees to do this, the judgment will be removed from your record.</p>
<p>To apply, complete this form and return it to the court: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice</a>.</p>
<p>You may have to pay a court fee of up to £255. You might be eligible to get help with court fees.</p>
<p>The court could ask you go to a hearing to explain why you don't owe the money.</p>
<p>If you don't go to the hearing, the court could reject your application and order you to pay the amount listed in this judgment.</p>
