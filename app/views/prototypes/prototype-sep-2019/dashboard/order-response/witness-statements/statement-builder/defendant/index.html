        <h1 class="heading-large">Explain your response with evidence</h1>
        <p>Tell us what you believe happened and how your evidence proves it.</p>

        <p>We'll use your answers to make a witness statement - a document that explains your view of the case to a judge.</p>
        <p>Don't worry if you repeat what you've said earlier in your response.</p>

        <p>We will ask the following questions to build your witness statement:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>Is your original response still accurate?</li>
          <li>What was agreed?</li>
          <li>What actually happened?</li>
          <li>Why don't you owe the money?</li>
          <li>Anything else?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Follow these guidelines:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>back up your statements by referencing the evidence you have uploaded</li>
          <li>make sure you use the reference number for each piece of evidence</li>
          <li>provide sources for any other facts you use</li>
          <li>try to stick to facts, not opinions</li>
          <li>avoid using jargon or technical language</li>
        </ul>
