        You have a County Court Judgment (CCJ)
      </h1>

      <p>{{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} requested a CCJ against you because you didn't respond to their money claim.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium" style="margin-top:40px;">What this means</h3>
      <p>The court believes you owe {{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} £1,500.</p>
      <p>The judgment explains how the court has ordered you to pay.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="/prototypes/prototype-may-2019/defendant/correspondence/forms/judgment-order?check=1">Download the CCJ</a></p>
      <p>A CCJ may make it harder to get credit, such as a mobile phone contract, credit card or mortgage.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium" style="margin-top:40px;">What are my options?</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-small">Settle the claim</h3>
            <p>If {{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} tells us you've paid or agreed to settle the claim another way, the judgment will be marked as satisfied. It will stay on the register for 6 years.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-small" style="margin-top:40px;">If you don't believe you owe the money</h3>
            <p>Because you didn't respond in time, you can only dispute the claim by applying to cancel the CCJ.</p>
            <p>The court will only cancel the CCJ if it accepts you didn't hear about the claim when {{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} made it against you.<p>
            <p>It costs £255 to ask the court to consider your request. You can't get the fee back, whether or not the court accepts your request.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-small" style="margin-top:40px;">If the court cancels the judgment</h3>
            <p>When you apply to cancel, we'll also ask you to submit a defence to the original claim.</p>
            <p>If the court cancels the judgment, we'll ask {{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} to respond to your defence.</p>
            <p>If not, your defence will be cancelled. You'll have to pay {{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} £1,500.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-small" style="margin-top:40px;">If you owe the money but can't pay now</h3>
            <p>You can ask to change when you pay {{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }}. You'll still owe £1,500 but you can ask to pay by a different date or in instalments.</p>
            <p>You'll have to pay the court a £50 fee to make the request.</p>
            <p>{{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} can accept or refuse your request. If they refuse, the court will review the case.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium" style="margin-top:40px;">What if I do nothing?</h3>
            <p>{{ partyName( 'claimant' ) }} can use enforcement options to recover the money. These include asking the court to:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
              <li>send bailiffs to collect the money</li>
              <li>take money out of your wages or any sale of land or property</li>
                </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-small"  style="margin-top:40px;">Reason for claim</h2>
      <p>This claim is about building works.</p>
      <p>{{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} and I signed a contract for building works on my roof. The work on the roof was completed but
        there was a problem with one section. I asked {{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} to get the problem fixed, but didn't get a
        reply.</p>
      <p>I phoned several times and even sent a letter but I got no response.</p>


      {% if data['scenario2'] == 'true' %}
        <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £570.</P>
      {% else %}
        <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,430.</P>
        <p>Therefore, I'm making a money
          claim for £1,500 to compensate for the money I'm going to need to spend on the roof and also the claim fee.</p>
