        How mediation works
      </h1>

      <p>The mediation service will contact you and Mary Richards to arrange an appointment with a mediator.</p>

      <p>You'll talk to the mediator one-on-one - you won't talk to Mary Richards directly. The call will last up to an hour.</p>

      <p>The mediator will:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>ask questions that help to uncover underlying problems</li>
        <li>look for areas of possible compromise</li>
        <li>ask you and Mary Richards to be flexible</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If mediation is successful you'll be asked to sign an agreement to formalise the settlement. If anyone breaks the terms of the agreement the case will go to court.</p>
