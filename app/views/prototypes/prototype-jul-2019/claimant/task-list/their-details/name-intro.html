          Get the company's full legal name right

            Your claim will fail if you don't use the company's full legal name.

        </div>

        <p class="exclamation"></p>

        <p>The company's full legal name is often different to the name it's commonly known by.</p>
        <p>The full legal name will almost always end in 'limited', 'ltd' or 'plc' and can sometimes be completely different to the name you know.</p>

        <p>For example:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>KFC is <i>Kentucky Fried Chicken (Great Britain) Limited</i></li>
          <li>Currys PC World is <i>DSG Retail Limited</i></li>
          <li>Easyjet is <i>easyJet Airline Company Limited</i></li>
          <li>British Gas is <i>British Gas Trading Limited</i></li>
          <li>Saga Holidays is <i>ST&H Group Limited</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These names are just examples used to show the difference between a brand name and a full legal name.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">Where to find the company's full legal name</h2>
        <p>It's often best to ask them, but you could also try the following.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-small">Look at your paperwork</h2>
        <p>This could include quotes, estimates, contracts, invoices, receipts or terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>These will often include the company's full name in a footer or small print, rather than the logo or heading.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-small">The company's website</h2>
        <p>Websites often include legal documnts such as terms and conditions or privacy policies which state their full legal name.</p>
        <p>You could also try entering the name you know the business by and 'terms and conditions' into a search engine.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Have you found the company's full legal name?</h2>
