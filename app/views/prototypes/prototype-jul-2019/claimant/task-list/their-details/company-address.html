      <p>You can often find the registered address on a receipt or in the company's terms and conditions (these may be on their website).</p>
      <p>You can also <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/" target="_blank">search Companies House</a> (opens in new window), but watch out for different companies with similar names.</p>
      <p>If the registered address is outside England and Wales you can't use this service to make your claim.</p>
