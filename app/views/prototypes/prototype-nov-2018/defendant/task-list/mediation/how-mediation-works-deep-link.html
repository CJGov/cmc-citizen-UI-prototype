        How mediation works
      </h1>

      <!--<p>The mediation service will contact you and Jan Clark to arrange an appointment with a mediator.</p>-->

      <p>We'll contact you with an appointment with a mediator, unless you or Jan Clark chooses to opt out of mediation.</p>

      <p>The mediator might need to speak to you more than once, but the process won't last more than an hour.</p>

      <p>A mediator will:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>listen to each side separately - you won’t talk directly to the other side</li>
        <li>ask you to consider what the other side says, but won’t make you compromise</li>
        <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If mediation is successful you'll be asked to sign an agreement to formalise the settlement. If anyone breaks the terms of the agreement, the other party can apply to the court to enforce the agreement.</p>

      <p>If mediation is unsuccessful the claim will go to a hearing but it can't be mentioned in court.</p>
