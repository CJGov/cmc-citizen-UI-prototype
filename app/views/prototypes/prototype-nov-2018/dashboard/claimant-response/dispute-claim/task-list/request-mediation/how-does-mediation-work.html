        How mediation works
      </h1>

      <!--<p>The mediation service will contact you and Mary Richards to arrange an appointment with a mediator.</p>-->

      <p>We'll contact you with an appointment with a mediator, unless you choose to opt out of mediation.</p>

      <p>The mediator might need to speak to you more than once, but the process won't last more than an hour.</p>

      <p>A mediator will:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>listen to each side separately - you won’t talk directly to the other side</li>
        <li>ask you to consider what the other side says, but won’t make you compromise</li>
        <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
      </ul>

      <!--<p>If mediation is successful you'll be asked to sign an agreement to formalise the settlement. If anyone breaks the terms of the agreement the case will go to court.</p>-->

      <p>If you agree to settle your claim at mediation, you'll be asked to sign an agreement. You can apply to the court to enforce the agreement if Mary Richards doesn't follow its terms.</p>

      <p>If mediation is unsuccessful the claim will go to a hearing but it can't be mentioned in court.</p>

      <div class="form-group">
        <a class="button" href="statements-all">Continue with mediation</a>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 35px"><a href='no-mediation'>I don't want to try mediation</a></p>
