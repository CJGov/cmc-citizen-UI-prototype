        Some useful information about Help with Fees
      </h1>
      <p>Making an application for Help with Fees does not guarantee that you will get your fee covered.  You may still have to pay some or all of your court fee to get the claim issued (for the court system to officially start the claim and send details to the other side). When you apply for Help with Fees, you should receive an update from us within 5 working days, giving you the result of your application.

        If you want to apply for Help with Fees, you will complete an online form in a new window. This will give you a reference number. Please note the number and keep it safe, as you will need it later in the claim process.  (NB: if you have more than one claim going on, each claim must have a separate Help with Fees application and reference number).  
        You can send in your claim as soon as you have the Help with Fees reference number, but the claim will not be issued until the Help with Fees application has been processed by the court.  This is so that you will know what fees are covered and what you still have to pay. If you canâ€™t pay, or choose not to, the claim will not be issued. The claim will stop here unless you change your mind within 95 days.
        
        You may be asked by the court to email evidence in support of your application before your claim is issued.

        <p>
          When you apply for Help with Fees you will be asked for the number on your court or tribunal form.  Please note that this as N1.</p>
          <p>Make a note of the Help with Fees number when you make an application.</p>
          <p>You will need this number to make your claim when you are returned to this service.
