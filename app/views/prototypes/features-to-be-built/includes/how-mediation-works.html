  <h3 class="heading-medium">A mediator phones you</h3>
  <p>The mediator will:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>listen to each side separately - you won’t talk directly to the other side</li>
      <li>ask you to consider what the other side says</li>
      <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
    </ul>
      <p>The call won't take longer than an hour.</p>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">After the phone call</h3>
  <p>If mediation is successful you'll make a verbal agreement over the phone. We'll email the agreement to you. You won't have to sign anything but the agreement is binding.</p>

  <p>If either party breaks the terms, the other party can go back to the court to ask for a judgment or hearing.</p>

  <p>If mediation fails and a hearing is needed, any mediation discussions can't be mentioned in court.</p>-->




<p>We have automatically registered you for free telephone mediation from HM Courts and Tribunals Service.</p>

  <p>Mediation can be quicker and cheaper than going to court.</p>
</div>

<p>The defendant has already agreed to mediation. We’ll contact you, within 28 days after your response, to arrange a free appointment. The mediator speaks to each party separately, this is not a conference call.</p>

<p>Your mediation appointment will last for no more than an hour.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium">After mediation</h3>

<p>If mediation is successful, you’ll make a verbal agreement over the phone. A copy of the settlement is available to both parties. You do not have to sign anything, but the agreement is binding.</p>

<p>If either party breaks the terms the other party can go to court to ask for a judgment or hearing.</p>

<p>If mediation fails and a court hearing is needed, what happened during the mediation appointment cannot be mentioned in court.</p>

<p>You will not have to wait longer for a court hearing if you choose mediation.</p>
