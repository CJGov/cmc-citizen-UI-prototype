      <p>We'll contact you when they confirm you've settled. The judgement will remain but be marked as 'Satisfied'.</p>


      <p class="heading-medium">Applying to cancel the judgment (optional)</p>
      <p>The court will usually only cancel a CCJ if it accepts you didn't know about the claim at the time it was issued.</p>
      <!-- <p>You'll have to pay a fee of £255. You might have to go to a hearing.</p>  -->
      <!--
      <h2 class="heading-medium">Ask the claimant to agree to remove the CCJ</h2>
      <p>You may be able to get the judgment removed without a hearing if Jan Clark agrees.</p>
      <p>When you make arrangements to pay them, ask them to sign a document saying they're happy for the judgment to be removed. You can then give this to the court who'll consider your request.</p>
      <p><a href="/public/images/consenttosetaside.pdf" download>See an example template</a></p>
      <p>You'll still have to pay a £255 fee to ask the court to remove the judgment.</p>
