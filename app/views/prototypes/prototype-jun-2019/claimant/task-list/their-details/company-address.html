    <p>Follow these steps:</p>

      <li>don't assume the address of a branch or shop is the registered company address</li>
      <li>if you don't know the registered address, try to find it on a receipt or in the company's terms and conditions (these may be on their website)</li>
      <li>you can also <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/" target="_blank">search Companies House</a> (opens in new window)
      <li>make sure the registered address is in England or Wales - if not you can't use this service to make your claim</li>
