          <h1 class="heading-large">Getting the defendant's details right</h1>

          <p>It is crucial that you get the defendant's details correct.</p>
          <p>So much as a typo in a name, or suing a company by its trading name rather than its registered name, may prevent you from reclaiming your money.</p>

          <p>You need to be absolutely sure of:</p>
          <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li><strong class="bold-small">their trading status</strong> - whether they are an individual, a sole trader or a company</li>
            <li><strong class="bold-small">their full, legal name</strong> - for companies this may not be the name you know them by</li>
            <li><strong class="bold-small">their registered or home address</strong> - for companies such as shops this is unlikely to be the shop you visited</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The best thing to do is speak to the defendant and have them confirm these details in writing.</p>

          <p>Otherwise, we can help you find the correct details.</p>

          <div class="form-group">
            <input type="submit" class="button" value="Continue"/>
          </div>
