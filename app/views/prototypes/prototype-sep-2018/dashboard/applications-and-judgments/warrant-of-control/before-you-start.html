      <p>The court cannot guarantee you will get your money back. You should consider whether:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>you are likely to get your money and court fee from the defendant</li>
        <li>the defendant owes other people money or has other court judgments</li>
        <li>the defendant owns any goods or assets which can be taken and sold at auction</li>
        <li>the defendant is working</li>
        <li>the defendant has other earnings, such as income from investments</li>
        <li>the defendant has a bank, building society or other account</li>
        <li>the defendant owns property (a house); or</li>
        <li>anyone else owes the defendant money</li>
