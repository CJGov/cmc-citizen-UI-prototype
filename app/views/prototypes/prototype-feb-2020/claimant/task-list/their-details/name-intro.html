        </div>

        <p class="exclamation"></p>

        <p>The company's full legal name will be different from the brand name you know.</p>

        <p>For example:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>KFC is <i>Kentucky Fried Chicken (Great Britain) Limited</i></li>
          <li>Currys PC World is <i>DSG Retail Limited</i></li>
          <li>easyJet is <i>easyJet Airline Company Limited</i></li>
          <li>British Gas is <i>British Gas Trading Limited</i></li>
          <li>Saga Holidays is <i>ST&H Group Limited</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These names are just examples used to show the difference between a brand name and a full legal name. Don't assume they're correct or in date at the time you're making a claim.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">How to find a company's full legal name</h2>

        <p>The full legal name will almost always end in 'limited', 'ltd' or 'plc'.</p>

        <p>Try these steps to find it:</p>
        <ol class="list list-number">
          <li>Ask the company.</li>
          <li>Check your paperwork.</li>
          <li>Look online.</li>
          <li>Never use a trading name.</i>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="heading-small">Ask the company</h2>

        <p>Talk to someone you dealt with or contact the company and ask what its full legal name is.</p>

        <p>If your claim is connected to one branch of a chain, ask if the main company owns that branch or if it's a franchise.</p>

          <p>A franchise is a branch that's not owned by its parent brand. For example, a branch of McDonalds or Starbucks might be owned by another company.</p>

          <p>If you know you're claiming against a franchise, look for the full legal name of the company that owns the branch, not the main brand.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-small">Check your paperwork</h2>
        <p>Look for the full legal name on any quotes, estimates, contracts, invoices, till receipts or documents that list terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>You can often find it in the footer or in small print rather than in logos or headings.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>View an example of a full legal name on a receipt</summary>
          <img src="/public/images/receipt.png" alt="An image of a till receipt warning not to use the brand name at the top receipt, but instead to use the full legal name in the small print" />
        </details>

        <h2 class="heading-small">Look online</h2>
        <p>Go to the company's website and try to find the full legal name in terms and conditions or privacy policies.</p>
        <p>You could also try entering the name you know the business by and 'terms and conditions' into a search engine.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-small">Never use a trading name</h2>

        <p>If your paperwork says 'Saga Holidays is a trading name of ST&H Group Limited', then you should use 'ST&H Group Limited', the full legal name.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">Have you found the company's full legal name?</h2>
